        <p>Finally after..</p>
        <p>The dojo was closed for about 17 months. 
            The NY Aikikai offered zoom classes for most of those months. 
            After all the effort done to re-open the dojo, 
            finally Yamada Sensei got to teach on Tuesday June 8th. 
            It was a very festive day at the dojo.

        <p>Sadly..</p>
        <p>When the New York Aikikai announced its online classes 
            in response to the realities imposed by COVID, I supported their decision.  
            At that time, I saw these classes as an opportunity for the community to remain in touch.</p>
